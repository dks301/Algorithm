## What is an Algoritm?

An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that if followed accomplishes a particular task.

* well-defined computational procedure that tasks some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output.

* a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

* A tool for soving a well-specified computational problem. 



## Desirable Algorithm

An algorithm must satisfies the following criteria.

* <span style="color:red">Input</span>: zero or more inputs are supplied.
* <span style="color:red">Output</span>: at least one output should be produced as results of procedure.
* <span style="color:red">Definiteness</span>: each instruction should be clear and unambiguous (i.e.) not more than one meaning.
* <span style="color:red">Finiteness</span>: if all the instructions are traced in algorithm, then for all cases the algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
* <span style="color:red">Effectiveness</span>: every instruction must be very basic so that it can be carried out briefly said "Operation must be feasible".
